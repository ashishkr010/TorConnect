# TorConnect
This C program, "TorConnect," establishes a secure connection to a target website via the Tor network using a SOCKS5 proxy. By connecting to Tor's local proxy at 127.0.0.1:9050, it routes traffic from any Linux command directly through Tor, providing privacy and anonymity for command-line operations.
